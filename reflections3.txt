When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your work or collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This allows you the flexible option of working offline on your local repository.
    You only pull changes when you need it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of other people's repositories that you want copied over
    to your account without interrupting theirs. Clones are exact copies. Branches
    consist of a series of commits in your project. You would want to use forks if
    you just want to read someone else's project but not modify it for them for example.
    Cloning is necessary if you want to have it on your local computer to work on.
    Branches consist of commits so they apply to all areas.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It acts as a backup before any changes are made to the remote. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You can collaborate by using other version control software like tortoise SVN.
    Since the other software is not as popular as git/github, it would be harder to
    share.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You would want to make changes in a separate branch to test out a new feature
    but with the insurance that if it goes wrong, it won't affect the mainline project.
    If the separate branch goes well then you can push it to your forked repo and then
    make a pull request.
